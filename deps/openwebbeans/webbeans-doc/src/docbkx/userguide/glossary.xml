	OpenEJB is an open source, embeddable and lightweight EJB Container
	System and EJB Server, released under the Apache 2.0 License. OpenEJB
	has been integrated with J2EE application servers such as Geronimo[1],
	and WebObjects[2].

	The role of OpenEJB is to create a runtime environment to run EJBs and let
	others access them in a unified way. Regardless of which application
	wants to access the beans, they all do it the same way, by accessing
	the appropriate Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) context and
	looking up a home object. Think about JNDI as a catalog of names with
	objects bound to them. JNDI Initial Context is the starting point when
	working with the catalog--looking up a name or accessing the object
	bound to it. OpenEJB can run in two modes: Local (AKA IntraVM) Server
	and Remote Server.
